Jed: Looks good overall on max sizing. One thing to do would be to make the images show up as the background image of the thumbnail instead of as an <img> inside of the thumbnail. Also look into how to get text to show up over the background images. Maybe work on adjusting the padding and/or margin sizes on the elements so that there is no white space left between. The fonts in the header look really nice.
